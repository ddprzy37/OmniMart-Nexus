## Description

The E-Commerce API project is a RESTful web service designed to manage an online store's categories and products. This API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on categories and products within the store. It uses Node.js with Express for the server, Sequelize as an ORM for interacting with a PostgreSQL database, and follows best practices for RESTful API design.

- Motivation: To create a backend for an e-commerce store.
- Problems: Routing was a big issues here.


### Built With
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, which allows for server-side scripting and the creation of scalable network applications.

* Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware management, making it easier to build RESTful APIs.

* Sequelize: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Node.js that supports multiple SQL databases, including PostgreSQL. It provides an easy way to interact with the database using JavaScript objects and methods.

* PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage the data for categories and products in the e-commerce application.
